<h2>UNC Math Contest 2022: Overall Results</h2>

Scoring follows the formula outlined in the rules, with a slight adjustment. 
The Power Round was intended to be out of 50 points, but ended up being out of 150 points. 
Due to this, the Power Round score is weighted 2x instead of 6x to keep it as contributing 300 points towards the overall score.
